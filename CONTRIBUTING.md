Contributions are very welcome, ideally anything that makes this more generic and easier for other people to use in their own environments.

Quick guide to contributing:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create your branch `git checkout -b branch-name` **bonus for feature branches**.
3. Make your changes.
4. Test to make sure you have not broken any existing functionality.
5. Commit your changes.
6. Push to your branch.
7. Submit a pull request.

I will do my best to merge your PR or provide feedback as soon as possible!
